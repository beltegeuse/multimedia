        abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new approach to perform multiple error correction in wireless
communications over error-prone networks. It is based on the cyclic redundancy check syndrome, using an
optimized lookup table that avoids performing arithmetic operations. This method is able to achieve the same
correction performance as the state-of-the-art approaches while significantly reducing the computational
complexity. The table is designed to allow multiple bit error correction simply by navigating within it. Its
size is constant when considering more than two errors, which represents a tremendous advantage over
earlier lookup table-based approaches. Simulation results of a C implementation performed on a Raspberry
Pi 4 show that the proposed method is able to process single and double error corrections of large payloads in
100 ns and 642 {\ensuremath{\mu}}s, respectively, while it would take 300 {\ensuremath{\mu}}s and 1.5 s, respectively, with the state-of-the-art
CRC multiple error correction technique. This represents a speedup of nearly 3000{$\times$}{$\times$}{$\times$} for single error and
2300{$\times$}{$\times$}{$\times$} for double error correction, respectively. Compared to table-based approaches, the proposed method
offers a speedup of nearly 1200{$\times$}{$\times$}{$\times$} for single error and 2300{$\times$}{$\times$}{$\times$} for double error correction under the same
conditions. We also show that when multiple candidate error patterns are present, numerous errors can be
corrected by adding a checksum cross-validation step.},

        abstract = {The rapid growth of video consumption and multimedia applications has increased the interest
of the academia and industry in building tools that can evaluate perceptual video quality. Since videos
might be distorted when they are captured or transmitted, it is imperative to develop reliable methods
for no-reference video quality assessment (NR-VQA). To date, most NR-VQA models in prior art have
been proposed for assessing a specific category of distortion, such as authentic distortions or traditional
distortions. Moreover, those developed for both authentic and traditional distortions video databases have
so far led to poor performances. This resulted in the reluctance of service providers to adopt multiple
NR-VQA approaches, as they prefer a single algorithm capable of accurately estimating video quality in
all situations. Furthermore, many existing NR-VQA methods are computationally complex and therefore
impractical for various real-life applications. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning method for
NR-VQA based on multi-task learning where the distortion of individual frames in a video and the overall
quality of the video are predicted by a single neural network. This enables to train the network with a greater
amount and variety of data, thereby improving its performance in testing. Additionally, our method leverages
temporal attention to select the frames of a video sequence which contribute the most to its perceived quality.
The proposed algorithm is evaluated on five publicly-available video quality assessment (VQA) databases
containing traditional and authentic distortions. Results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-
art on traditional distortion databases such as LIVE VQA and CSIQ video, while also delivering competitive
performance on databases containing authentic distortions such as KoNViD-1k, LIVE-Qualcomm and

However, this new structure results in a dramatically increased complexity that makes real-time HEVC encoding very challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel CU size decision method based on deep reinforcement learning and active feature acquisition to reduce HEVC intra coding computational complexity and encoding time. The proposed method carries out early splitting and early splitting termination by considering the encoder and CU as an agent-environment system. More specifically, through early splitting, the proposed method precludes the need for rate-distortion optimization at the current level. In addition, through early splitting termination, it disposes of the lower level computations. The proposed method provides a very fast encoder with a small quality penalty. Experimental results show that it achieves a 51.3\% encoding time reduction on average with a small quality loss of 0.041 dB for the BD-PSNR, when we compare our method to the HEVC test model.},

Nevertheless, SEA is often only used in conjunction with exhaustive search algorithms (e.g., full search). In this paper, we combine the multi-level successive elimination algorithm (ML-SEA) and the rate-constrained successive elimination algorithm (RCSEA) and show that they can be advantageously applied to suboptimal search algorithms. We demonstrate that the savings brought about by the new multi-level RCSEA (ML-RCSEA) outweigh the pre-computational costs of this approach for the Test Zonal (TZ) Search algorithm found in the HM reference encoder. We propose a novel multi-level composition pattern for performing RCSEA on an asymmetric partitioning. We introduce a double-check mechanism for RCSEA, and show that on average, it avoids computing 71\% of motion vector (MV) costs. We also apply the proposed ML-RCSEA to bi-predictive refinement search and leverage a cost-based search ordering to remove 56\% of error metric computations, on average. When compared to the HM reference encoder, our experiments show that the proposed solution reduces the TZ Search time by approximately 45\%, contributing to an average encoding time reduction of about 7\%, without increasing the Bj{\o}ntegaard delta rate (BD-Rate).},

This results in an increased encoder complexity, since there are more modes to be processed by the high resource-demanding rate-distortion optimization (RDO). In this paper, we propose a novel method to reduce the HEVC intra mode decision computational complexity and encoding time. This method is based on the prediction of the RDO cost of intra modes from a low-complexity sum of absolute transformed differences-based cost. By predicting the RDO cost, we are able to exclude non-promising modes from further processing and thereby save substantial computations. Also, a gradient-based method, using the Prewitt operator, is proposed to eliminate the non-relevant directional modes from the list of candidates. For even more complexity reduction, a mode classification is proposed to adaptively reduce chroma intra modes based on block texture. Experimental results show that we achieve a 47.3\% encoding time reduction on average with a negligible quality loss of 0.062 dB for the Bj{\o}ntegaard delta peak signal-to-noise ratio when we compare our method to the HEVC test model 15.0.},

        abstract = {3D and multi-view 360-degree videos offer 3D immersive visual experience of the real world on head-mounted displays (HMDs). They are used in extended reality applications (including virtual reality, augmented reality and mixed reality) such as gaming, entertainment, education and medicine. However, these applications require a very high rate of compression and a great deal of computational resources. Compression efficiency and coding complexity are highly influenced by 360 projections used to map spherical frames to rectangular frames. To study the effect of this mapping process, in this paper, we evaluate the performance of various projections in 3D and multi-view 360-degree videos in terms of coding efficiency, quality and complexity. The evaluation is conducted for two coding scenarios: stereo coding scenario where the encoder considers the interview dependency for disparity estimation and simulcast coding scenario where two views are encoded separately. This performance evaluation approach provides valuable insights on using 360-degree projections in 3D and multi-view coding.},

        abstract = {In this paper, we propose a fast H.264-to-HEVC transcoder composed of a motion propagation algorithm and a fast mode decision framework. The motion propagation algorithm creates a motion vector candidate list at the coding tree unit (CTU) level and, thereafter, selects the best candidate at the prediction unit level. This method eliminates computational redundancy by pre-computing the prediction error of each candidate at the CTU level and reusing the information for various partition sizes. The fast mode decision framework is based on a post-order traversal of the CTU and includes several mode reduction techniques. In particular, the framework permits the early termination of the rate distortion cost computation, a highly complex task, when a mode is unpromising. Moreover, a novel method exploits the data created by the motion propagation algorithm to determine whether a coding unit must be split. This allows the pruning of unpromising sub-partitions. Compared with a cascaded pixel-domain transcoding approach, the experimental results show that the proposed solution using one reference frame is on average 8.5 times faster, for an average Bj{\o}ntegaard delta-rate (BD-Rate) of 2.63\%. For a configuration with four reference frames, the average speed-up is 11.77 times and the average BD-Rate is 3.82\%.},

Reconstructed packets may exhibit significant degradation in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio and visual quality. This paper presents a novel list-decoding approach exploiting the receiver side user datagram protocol (UDP) checksum. The proposed method identifies the possible locations of errors by analyzing the pattern of the calculated UDP checksum. This permits considerably reducing the number of candidate bitstreams in comparison to conventional list decoding approaches. When a packet composed of N bits contains a single-bit error, instead of considering N candidate bitstreams, as is the case in conventional list decoding approaches, the proposed approach considers N/32 candidate bitstreams, leading to a reduction of 97\% of the number of candidates. For a two-bit error, the reduction increases to 99.6\%. The method's performance is evaluated using H.264 and H.265 test model software. Our simulation results reveal that, on average, the error was corrected perfectly 80\%-90\% of the time (the original bitstream was recovered). In addition, the proposed approach provides, on average, a 2.79-dB gain over frame copy (FC) error concealment using the joint model and a 3.57-dB gain over our implementation of FC error concealment in the High Efficiency Video Coding test model.},

Massively parallel architectures, such as graphics processing units (GPUs), used in combination with a multi-core central processing unit (CPU), provide a promising computing platform to achieve fast encoding. However, the dependencies in deriving motion vector predictors (MVPs) prevent the parallelization of prediction units (PUs) processing at a frame level. Moreover, the conditional execution structure of typical fast search algorithms is not suitable for GPUs designed for data-intensive parallel problems. In this paper, we propose a novel highly parallel RCME method based on multiple temporal motion vector (MV) predictors and a new fast nested diamond search (NDS) algorithm well-suited for a GPU. The proposed framework provides fine-grained encoding parallelism. Experimental results show that our approach provides reduced GPU load with better BD-Rate compared to prior full search parallel methods based on a single MV predictor.},

Although the documents can be accessed via Web browsers, their correctness is not guaranteed. In content selection, the document is adapted into various versions, from which the optimal one, based on a quality of experience (QoE) criterion, is delivered. Existing works evaluate the QoE of each content version using the user's preferences and context parameters, such as device resolution and network bitrate. They ask the user to weight the context parameters, and then combine them using the simple-additive-weighting (SAW) method. However, not all users are familiar with the context parameters, and cannot understand their relationship with the requested content. Besides, not all parameters are compensatory to be summed up. In this paper, we propose a TOPSIS-based QoE model to address the two aforementioned drawbacks. We use the context parameters to define high-level functions understandable by all users, and combine them using the TOPSIS method. Experimental results show the convenience of our QoE model and its reliability over the SAW-based method, as well as the weighting-product (WP) method, which is used as an alternative to the SAW one.},

In this paper, we present an automatic method to generate relative depth maps from monocular video sequences. It relies on the dynamic occlusion depth cue to recover the depth order of objects in the scene. The forward and backward motion analysis between each two consecutive frames allows the calculation of their dynamic occlusions. We estimate the motion using a modified version of the EpicFlow. Our modifications to this optical flow method made it coherent in forward-backward directions without compromising its performance. Thanks to this new feature, occlusions are simpler to calculate than the approaches used in the relevant literature. The obtained occlusions allow order deduction of the objects contained in the image. These objects are obtained using a segmentation approach which considers both color and motion. Ours results show a small improvement to the quality of the optical flow while adding the forward/backward coherence. With respect to the depth ordering our approach obtains slightly better results than the reference method while removing a computationally costly step from the processing.},

In most cases (90 \%), the PSNR value obtained when modifying an NDB is very close to the intact value.

The novelty in this paper is that instead of relying on a static geometric pattern (i.e., like a spiral), we proposed a dynamic algorithm that creates a cost-based search orderings. A dynamic cost-based search ordering not only improves elimination but also allows for early termination which removes, on average, 61\% of the block-matching loop iterations performed by the rate-constrained successive elimination algorithm (RCSEA). Our experiments show that the proposed solution is 5 times faster than the high efficiency video coding (HEVC) HM encoder software in full search mode with a 0.02\% impact on BD-Rate.

To deliver optimally adapted slides, a trade-off between the visual aspect and delivery time must be reached. Static adaptation methods are CPU-intensive, and require large storage space. The dynamic approach is attractive as the optimal version is created on the fly when the actual slide is to be shared. Existing dynamic solutions are optimized for the resolution of the target mobile device and use good visual quality settings. However, they do not control the resulting data size, which creates serious usability issues, such as increasing the delivery time. Prediction-based methods require much less memory and processing resources than static approaches while yielding an excellent user experience. In this paper, we propose a multi-objective dynamic content adaptation framework, in which we maximize the visual quality and minimize the delivery time simultaneously. We compare our solution with an ideal optimal point, called utopia, and with all the optimal solutions (Pareto front) provided by a static exhaustive system. The obtained results show that our framework yields solutions very close to the utopia and, for the majority of the documents tested, the obtained solutions are on the Pareto front.},

        abstract = {Rate-constrained motion estimation (RCME) is considered to be the most time-consuming process of H.265/HEVC encoding. Massively parallel architectures, such as graphics processing units (GPUs), used in combination with a multi-core central processing unit (CPU), provide a promising computing platform to achieve fast encoding. However, the inherent dependencies in the process for deriving motion vector predictors (MVPs) prevent the parallelization of prediction units (PUs) processing. In this paper, we present a framework for performing a two-stage parallel RCME, in which the RCME of all the PUs of a frame can be calculated in parallel. A novel method is introduced to overcome the dependencies inherent to the derivation of MVPs. Multiple temporal predictors (MTPs) within the two-stage parallel RCME framework provide fine-grained parallelism encoding without significant BD-Rate penalty, compared to serial encoding. Experimental results show that our proposed approach achieves a BD-Rate improvement of over 1\% as compared to state-of-the-art parallel methods providing similar time reductions.},

To achieve this improved coding performance, HEVC presents a new content-adaptive approach to split a frame into coding units (CUs), along with an increased number of prediction modes, which results in significant computational complexity. To lower this complexity with intra coding, in this paper, we develop a new method based on global and directional gradients to terminate the CU splitting procedure early and prevent processing of unnecessary depths. The global and directional gradients determine if the unit is predicted with high accuracy at the current level, and where that's the case, the CU is deemed to be non-split. Experimental results show that the proposed method reduces the encoding time by 52\% on average, with a small quality loss of 0.07 dB (BD-PSNR) for all-intra scenarios, as compared to the HEVC reference implementation, HM 15.0.},

The proposed solution is based on a sub-pixel disparity estimation algorithm that takes into consideration the spherical shape of the retinal fundus. A sub-pixel approach is adopted in order to achieve high precision disparity estimation. Moreover, the a priori knowledge of the fundus geometric shape provides useful information for the regularization of the high precision disparity estimation process. Stereo images, with known ground truth, are used to evaluate the proposed algorithm and to demonstrate the high precision of estimated disparity in our methods.},

        abstract = {In this work, we study the performance of the maximum likelihood decoding (MLD) approach in error-resilient video sequences to establish the performance improvement of this method compared to well-known error concealment approaches. In particular, we consider various interactions between error resilience coding and error concealment/correction. The error resilience methods under consideration include random intra macroblock updating and weighted error resilience. For error concealment/correction, we consider (i) the frame copy (FC), (ii) spatio-temporal boundary matching error concealments (STBMA), and (iii) MLD error correction. Our experimental results show that the best performance is achieved when the MLD interacts with weighted error resilience. Together, they yield, on average, about a 2 dB gain over using FC error concealment with weighted error resilience and a 1 dB gain over STBMA with identical error resilience. Furthermore, MLD with error resilience can be more than 10 dB better than FC without error resilience in certain cases.},

We show that conventional search orderings, such as spiral search, can weaken the filtering criterion of rate-constrained successive elimination algorithms. Based on this new insight, we derive a new search ordering that takes into account the impact of the rate constraint. Our simulation results demonstrate that, on average, the amount of SAD operations required to encode the tested sequences, is reduced by 2.86\%, when compared to the H.264 JM reference software's implementation of spiral search. For sequences with unpredictable motion, this reduction is greater than 5\% and can exceed 10\% when smaller block partitions are evaluated.},

In this paper, we show that, in a wide range of operating conditions, selectively reusing data resulting from decodable errorneous packets leads to better results than frame copy. This selection is guided by a novel concept that combines motion estimation and a measure of blocking artifacts at block edges to predict visual degradation caused by the decoding of erroneous packets. Simulation results show that, by using the proposed solution, the H.264/AVC JM reference software decoder can select the best option between frame copy and the erroneous frame decoding in 82\% of test cases. We also obtain an average gain of 1.95 dB for concealed frames (when they differ from those concealed by the JM decoder).},

        abstract = {The visual information fidelity (VIF) index is an objective quality metric that gives very accurate image similarity scores, but at the cost of very high computational complexity. In this paper, a method is presented for calculating VIF in the discrete wavelet domain using the Haar wavelet. The proposed method exploits scalar Gaussian Scale Mixture (GSM) instead of vector GSM for calculating the prediction scores. The complexity of the proposed method is assessed for five different popular image sizes and compared to other methods based on a C/C++ implementation of the algorithms. Experimental results show that the proposed method can compute the visual quality score with less than 30\% of the computational complexity of the well-known SSIM index, with greater accuracy than that achieved by the original VIF index method (at about 5\% of its computational complexity).},

        abstract = {The structural similarity (SSIM) index is an objective metric that gives relatively accurate similarity prediction scores with reasonable complexity. In this paper, an excellent trade-off between accuracy and complexity is presented in the form of a wavelet structural similarity index (WSSI), which is more accurate and less complex than the spatial SSIM index. Like the spatial SSIM index, the WSSI has the feature of boundedness. It computes an edge structural similarity map and an approximation structural similarity map to obtain the final similarity score. A contrast map is introduced in the wavelet domain for pooling structural similarity maps. Experimental results show that the low-complexity WSSI gives a correlation coefficient of 0.9548 between objective and subjective scores, and competes with visual information fidelity (VIF) performance.},
