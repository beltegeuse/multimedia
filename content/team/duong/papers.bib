        abstract = {Background -- 
Navigation guidance in cardiac interventions is provided by X-ray angiography. Cumulative radiation exposure is a serious concern for pediatric cardiac interventions.

Purpose -- 
A generative learning-based approach is proposed to predict X-ray angiography frames to reduce the radiation exposure for pediatric cardiac interventions while preserving the image quality.

Methods -- 
Frame predictions are based on a model-free motion estimation approach using a long short-term memory architecture and a content predictor using a convolutional neural network structure. The presented model thus estimates contrast-enhanced vascular structures such as the coronary arteries and their motion in X-ray sequences in an end-to-end system. This work was validated with 56 simulated and 52 patients' X-ray angiography sequences.

Results -- 
Using the predicted images can reduce the number of pulses by up to three new frames without affecting the image quality. The average required acquisition can drop by 30\% per second for a 15 fps acquisition. The average structural similarity index measurement was 97\% for the simulated dataset and 82\% for the patients' dataset.

Conclusions -- 
Frame prediction using a learning-based method is promising for minimizing radiation dose exposure. The required pulse rate is reduced while preserving the frame rate and the image quality. With proper integration in X-ray angiography systems, this method can pave the way for improved dose management.},

        abstract = {Purpose -- 
Ventricular septal defects (VSDs) are common congenital heart malformations. Echocardiography used during VSD hybrid cardiac procedures requires extensive training for image acquisition and interpretation. Cardiac surgery simulators with heart phantoms have shown usefulness for such training, but they are limited in visualization and characterization of complex VSD. This study explores a new method to build patient-specific heart phantoms with VSD, with proper tissue echogenicity for ultrasound imaging.

Methods -- 
Heart phantoms were designed from preoperative imaging of three patients with complex VSDs. Each whole heart phantom, including atrial and ventricular septums, was obtained by manual segmentation and by surface reconstruction, then by molding and by casting in different materials. Heart phantoms in silicone and polyvinyl alcohol cryogel (PVA-C) were considered, and they were reconstructed in 3-D using 2-D freehand ultrasound imaging.

Results -- 
An electromagnetic measurement system was used to measure the mean VSD diameters from the heart phantoms. Errors were evaluated below 1.0 mm for mean VSD diameters between 6.2 and 7.5 mm.

Conclusion -- 
Patient-specific heart phantoms promise for representing complex heart malformations such as VSDs. PVA-C showed better tissue echogenicity than silicone for VSDs visualization and characterization.},

        abstract = {Purpose -- 
Coronary artery events are mainly associated with atherosclerosis in adult population, which is recognized as accumulation of plaques in arterial wall tissues. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a light-based imaging system used in cardiology to analyze intracoronary tissue layers and pathological formations including plaque accumulation. This state-of-the-art catheter-based imaging system provides intracoronary cross-sectional images with high resolution of 10-15 um. But interpretation of the acquired images is operator dependent, which is not only very time-consuming but also highly error prone from one observer to another. An automatic and accurate coronary plaque tagging using OCT image post-processing can contribute to wide adoption of the OCT system and reducing the diagnostic error rate.

Method -- 
In this study, we propose a combination of spatial pyramid pooling module with dilated convolutions for semantic segmentation to extract atherosclerotic tissues regardless of their types and training a sparse auto-encoder to reconstruct the input features and enlarge the training data as well as plaque type characterization in OCT images.

Results -- 
The results demonstrate high precision of the proposed model with reduced computational complexity, which can be appropriate for real-time analysis of OCT images. At each step of the work, measured accuracy, sensitivity, specificity of more than 93\% demonstrate high performance of the model.

Conclusion -- 
The main focus of this study is atherosclerotic tissue characterization using OCT imaging. This contributes to wide adoption of the OCT imaging system by providing clinicians with a fully automatic interpretation of various atherosclerotic tissues. Future studies will be focused on analyzing atherosclerotic vulnerable plaques, those coronary plaques which are prone to rupture.},

Coronary artery events in the adult are primarily due to atherosclerosis with seventy-five percent of the related mortality caused by plaque rupture. Despite significant progress made to improve intravascular imaging of coronary arteries, there is still a large gap between clinical needs and technical developments. The goal of this review is to identify the gap elements between clinical knowledge and recent advances in the domain of medical image analysis. Efficient image analysis computational models should be designed with respect to the exact clinical needs, and detailed features of the tissues under review. In this review, we discuss the detailed clinical features of the intracoronary plaques for mathematical and biomedical researchers. We emphasize the importance of integrating this clinical knowledge validated by clinicians to investigate the potentially effective models for proper features efficiency in the scope of leveraging the state-of-the-art of coronary image analyses.},

The Risser sign used in skeletal maturity assessment is commonly accepted in AIS patient's management. However, the Risser sign is subject to inter-observer variability and it relies mainly on the observation of ossification on the iliac crests. This study proposes a new machine-learning-based approach for Risser sign skeletal maturity assessment using EOS radiographs. Regions of interest including right and left humeral heads; left and right femoral heads; and pelvis are extracted from the radiographs. First, a total of 24 image features is extracted from EOS radiographs using a ResNet101-type convolutional neural network (CNN), pre-trained from the ImageNet database. Then, a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm is used for the final Risser sign classification. The experimental results demonstrate an overall accuracy of 84\%, 78\%, and 80\% respectively for iliac crests, humeral heads, and femoral heads. Class activation maps using Grad-CAM were also investigated to understand the features of our model. In conclusion, our machine learning approach is promising to incorporate a large number of image features for different regions of interest to improve Risser grading for skeletal maturity. Automatic classification could contribute to the management of AIS patients.},

The finite element method (FEM) is the preferred method to simulate phenomena in anatomical structures. However, purely FEM-based mechanical simulations require considerable time, limiting their use in clinical applications that require real-time responses, such as haptics simulators. Machine learning (ML) approaches have been proposed to help with the reduction of the required time. The present paper reviews cases where ML could help to generate faster simulations, without considerably affecting the performance results.

Methods -- 
This review details the ML approaches used, considering the anatomical structures involved, the data collection strategies, the selected ML algorithms, with corresponding features, the metrics used for validation, and the resulting time gains.

Results -- 
A total of 41 references were found. ML algorithms are mainly trained with FEM-based simulations in 32 publications. The preferred ML approach is neural networks, including deep learning in 35 publications. Tissue deformation is simulated in 18 applications, but other features are also considered. The average distance error and mean squared error are the most frequently used performance metrics, in 14 and 17 publications, respectively. The time gains were considerable, going from hours or minutes for purely FEM-based simulations to milliseconds, when using ML.

Conclusions -- 
ML algorithms can be used to accelerate FEM-based biomechanical simulations of anatomical structures, possibly reaching real-time responses. Fast and real-time simulations of anatomical structures, generated with ML algorithms, can help to reduce the time required by FEM-based simulations and accelerate their adoption in the clinical practice.},

Morbidity caused by coronary heart disease is a substantial cause of acute coronary syndrome and sudden cardiac death. The most common intracoronay complications caused by coronary artery disease are intimal hyperplasia, calcification, fibrosis, neovascularization and macrophage accumulation, which require efficient prevention strategies. OCT can provide discriminative information of the intracoronary tissues, which can be used to train a robust fully automatic tissue characterization model based on deep learning. In this study, we aimed to design a diagnostic model of coronary artery lesions. Particularly, we trained a random forest using convolutional neural network features to distinguish between normal and diseased arterial wall structure. Then, based on the arterial wall structure, fully convolutional network is designed to extract the tissue layers in normal cases, and pathological tissues regardless of lesion type in pathological cases. Then, the type of the lesions can be characterized with high precision using our previous model. The results demonstrate the robustness of the model with the approximate overall accuracy up to 90\%.},

The purpose of this study is to evaluate a freehand 3D ultrasound system for volumetric reconstruction of the spine. A setup consisting of an ultrasound scanner with a linear transducer, an electromagnetic measuring system and a workstation was used. We conducted 64 acquisitions of US images of 8 adults in a natural standing position, and we tested three setups: 1) Subjects are constrained to be close to a wall, 2) Subjects are unconstrained, and 3) Subjects are constrained to performing fast and slow acquisitions. The spinous processes were manually selected from the volume reconstruction from tracked ultrasound images to generate a 3D point-based model depicting the centerline of the spine. The results suggested that a freehand 3D ultrasound system can be suitable for representing the spine. Volumetric reconstructions can be computed and landmarking can be performed to model the surface of the spine in the 3D space. These reconstructions promise to generate computer-based descriptors to analyze the shape of the spine in the 3D space.Clinical Relevance- We provide clinicians with a protocol that could be integrated in clinical setups for the assessment and monitoring of AIS, based on US image acquisitions, which constitutes a radiation-free technology.},

Materials and Methods -- 
In this institutional review board approved-study, a total of 1830 posteroanterior radiographs of patients with AIS (age range, 10-18 years, 70\% female) were collected retrospectively and graded manually by six trained readers using the United States Risser staging system. Each radiograph was preprocessed and cropped to include the entire pelvic region. A convolutional neural network was trained to automatically grade conventional radiographs according to the Risser classification. The network was then validated by comparing its accuracy against the interobserver variability of six trained graders from the authors' institution using the Fleiss {\ensuremath{\kappa}} statistical measure.

Results -- 
Overall agreement between the six observers was fair, with a {\ensuremath{\kappa}} coefficient of 0.65 for the experienced graders and agreement of 74.5\%. The automatic grading method obtained a {\ensuremath{\kappa}} coefficient of 0.72, which is a substantial agreement with the ground truth, and an overall accuracy of 78.0\%.

Conclusion -- 
The high accuracy of the model presented here compared with human readers suggests that this work may provide a new method for standardization of Risser grading. The model could assist physicians with the task, as well as provide additional insights in the assessment of bone maturity based on radiographs.},

The proposed method has been validated on clinical data providing an average accuracy of 94.9\%. Additionally, results show good transposition of learning from one type of artery to another. Epistemic uncertainty maps provide areas where the segmentation should be validated by an expert before being used, and could provide identification of regions of interest for data augmentation purposes.},

        abstract = {We present a novel model-free approach for cardiorespiratory motion prediction from X-ray angiography time series based on Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM-RNN). Cardiorespiratory motion prediction is defined as a problem of estimating the future displacement of the coronary vessels in the next image frame in an X-ray angiography sequence. The displacement of the vessels is represented as a sequence of 2D affine transformation matrices allowing 2D X-ray registrations in a sequence. The new displacement parameters from a sequence of transformation matrices are predicted using an LSTM model. LSTM is a particular form of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture suitable for learning sequential data and predicting time series. The method was developed and validated by simulated data using a realistic cardiorespiratory motion simulator (XCAT). The results show that this method converges quickly and can predict the complex motion in the angiography sequences with irregularities. The mean values of prediction error over all the patients are approximately 0.29 mm (2 pixels) difference for the combination of both motions, 0.51 mm (3.5 pixels) difference for cardiac motion and 0.44 mm (3 pixels) difference for respiratory motion.},

We aim to perform generation of angiograms for various vascular structures as a mean of data augmentation in learning tasks. The task is to enhance the realism of vessels images generated from an anatomically realistic cardiorespiratory simulator to make them look like real angiographies.

Methods -- 
The enhancement is performed by applying the CycleGAN deep network for transferring the style of real angiograms acquired during percutaneous interventions into a data set composed of realistically simulated arteries.

Results -- 
The cycle consistency was evaluated by comparing an input simulated image with the one obtained after two cycles of image translation. An average structural similarity (SSIM) of 0.948 on our data sets has been obtained. The vessel preservation was measured by comparing segmentations of an input image and its corresponding enhanced image using Dice coefficient.

Conclusions -- 
We proposed an application of the CycleGAN deep network for enhancing the artificial data as an alternative to classical data augmentation techniques for medical applications, particularly focused on angiogram generation. We discussed success and failure cases, explaining conditions for the realistic data augmentation which respects both the complex physiology of arteries and the various patterns and textures generated by X-ray angiography.},

The experiments are performed on 33 retrospective cases comprising of pullbacks of intracoronary cross-sectional images obtained from different pediatric patients with KD. Our approach evaluates deep features computed from three different pre-trained convolutional networks. Then, a majority voting approach is applied to provide the final classification result. The results demonstrate high values of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for each tissue (up to 0.99 {$\pm$} 0.01).

OCT has been known as an intracoronary imaging modality using near-infrared light which has recently been used to image the inner coronary artery tissues of pediatric patients, providing high spatial resolution (ranging from 10 to 20 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m). This study aims to develop a robust and fully automated tissue classification method by using the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as feature extractor and comparing the predictions of three state-of-the-art classifiers, CNN, random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM). The results show the robustness of CNN as the feature extractor and random forest as the classifier with classification rate up to 96\%, especially to characterize the second layer of coronary arteries (media), which is a very thin layer and it is challenging to be recognized and specified from other tissues.},

Early detection of blood vessel pathologies can be made through the evaluation of functional and structural abnormalities in the arteries, including the arterial distensibility measure. We propose a feasibility study on computing arterial distensibility automatically from monoplane 2D X-ray sequences for both small arteries (such as coronary arteries) and larger arteries (such as the aorta).

Methods
To compute the distensibility measure, three steps were developed: First, the segment of an artery is extracted using our graph-based segmentation method. Then, the same segment is tracked in the moving sequence using our spatio-temporal segmentation method: the Temporal Vessel Walker. Finally, the diameter of the artery is measured automatically at each frame of the sequence based on the segmentation results.

Results
The method was evaluated using one simulated sequence and 4 patients' angiograms depicting the coronary arteries and three depicting the ascending aorta. Results of the simulated sequence achieved a Dice index of 98\%, with a mean squared error in diameter measurement of   0.18{$\pm$}0.31  mm. Results obtained from patients' X-ray sequences are consistent with manual assessment of the diameter by experts.

Conclusions
The proposed method measures changes in diameter of a specific segment of a blood vessel during the cardiac sequence, automatically based on monoplane 2D X-ray sequence. Such information might become a key to help physicians in the detection of variations of arterial stiffness associated with early stages of various vasculopathies.},

However, to ensure a robust and accurate reconstruction, C-arm gantry parameters must be properly calibrated to provide clinically acceptable results. Calibration procedures often rely on calibration objects and complex protocol which is not adapted to an intervention context. In this study, a novel calibration algorithm for C-arm gantry is presented using the instrumentation such as catheters and guide wire. This ensures the availability of a minimum set of correspondences and implies minimal changes to the clinical workflow. The method was evaluated on simulated data and on retrospective patient datasets. Experimental results on simulated datasets demonstrate a calibration that allows a 3D reconstruction of the guide wire up to a geometric transformation. Experiments with patients datasets show a significant decrease of the retro projection error to 0.17 mm 2D RMS. Consequently, such procedure might contribute to identify any calibration drift during the intervention.},

OCT has been recently used in children following Kawasaki disease (KD), the most prevalent acquired coronary artery disease during childhood with devastating complications. The assessment of coronary artery layers with OCT and early detection of coronary sequelae secondary to KD is a promising tool for preventing myocardial infarction in this population. More importantly, OCT is promising for tissue quantification of the inner vessel wall, including neo intima luminal myofibroblast proliferation, calcification, and fibrous scar deposits. The goal of this study is to classify the coronary artery layers of OCT imaging obtained from a series of KD patients. Our approach is focused on developing a robust Random Forest classifier built on the idea of randomly selecting a subset of features at each node and based on second- and higher-order statistical texture analysis which estimates the gray-level spatial distribution of images by specifying the local features of each pixel and extracting the statistics from their distribution. The average classification accuracy for intima and media are 76.36\% and 73.72\% respectively. Random forest classifier with texture analysis promises for classification of coronary artery tissue.},

stenosis location detected. Finally, a set of stenting solutions is generated
and the pressure gradient calculated for each of them. The gradient
calculations are performed by means of Lattice-Boltzmann CFD simulations,
which are well suited for complex geometries and are comparatively
efficient in terms of execution time. The minimum gradient value will
constitute the optimal stent placement. This study showed that an improvement
of 60\% and 23\% of the pressure gradient could be obtained
by placing optimally the stent.},

        abstract = {The segmentation and tracking of coronary arteries (CAs) are critical steps for the computation of biophysical measurements in pediatric interventional cardiology. In the literature, most methods are focused on either segmenting the vessel lumen or on tracking the vessel centerline. However, they do not simultaneously combine the segmentation and tracking of a specific CA. This paper introduces a novel algorithm for CA segmentation and tracking from 2D X-ray angiography sequences. The proposed algorithm is based on the Temporal Vessel Walker (TVW) segmentation method, which combines graph-based formulation and temporal priors. Moreover, superpixel groups are used by TVW as image primitives to ensure a better extraction of the CA. The proposed algorithm, TVW with superpixels (SP-TVW), returns an accurate result to segment and track the artery along the angiogram. Quantitative results over 12 sequences of young patients show the accuracy of the proposed framework. The results return a mean recall of 84\% in the dataset. In addition, the proposed method returned a Dice index of 70\% in segmenting and tracking right coronary arteries and circumflex arteries. The performance of the proposed method surpasses the existing polyline method in tracking the centerline of CA with a more precise localization of the centerline, resulting in a smaller distance error of 0.23 mm compared to 0.94 mm.},

        abstract = {Stent size selection and placement is one of the most challenging
steps in the treatment of pulmonary artery stenosis, especially
for pediatric patients with smaller vasculature. The goal of this study
is to visually simulate stent placement and deployment, to assist the
physician in choosing an appropriate stent length and placement. First a
3D model of the pulmonary artery is segmented from a preoperative CT
scan. Second, a 3D stent model is scaled and aligned automatically at the
stenosis' location using a modified cylindrical affine transform. Finally,
the optimal stent size and placement are solved using a hill climbing
optimization scheme, to find the best outcome in the vicinity of the
stenosis. Validation of the proposed approach has been conducted using
annotated X-ray angiography acquired before and after stenting. Results
show an improvement of the vessel volume ranging from 0.10\% - 3.33\%.
This study is promising for preoperative planning before stenting.},

        abstract = {Image-based navigation during percutaneous coronary interventions is highly challenging since it involves estimating the 3D motion of a complex topology using 2D angiographic views. A static coronary tree segmented in a pre-operative CT-scan can be overlaid on top of the angiographic frames to outline the coronary vessels, but this overlay does not account for coronary motion, which has to be mentally compensated by the cardiologist. In this paper, we propose a new approach to the motion estimation problem, where the temporal evolution of the coronary deformation over the cardiac cycle is modeled as a stochastic process. The sequence of angiographic frames is interpreted as a probabilistic evidence of the succession of unknown deformation states, which can be optimized using particle filtering. Iterative and non-rigid registration is performed in a projective manner, and relies on a feature-based similarity measure. Experiments show promising results in terms of registration accuracy, learning capability and computation time.},

        abstract = {Percutaneous cardiac interventions rely mainly on the experience of the cardiologist to safely navigate inside soft tissues vessels under X-ray angiography guidance. Additional navigation guidance tool might contribute to improve reliability and safety of percutaneous procedures. This study focus on major aorta-pulmonary collateral arteries (MAPCAs) which are pediatric structures. We present a fully automatic intensity-based 3D/2D registration method that accurately maps pre-operatively acquired 3D tomographic vascular data of a newborn patient over intra-operatively acquired angiograms. The tomographic dataset 3D pose is evaluated by comparing the angiograms with simulated X-ray projections, computed from the pre-operative dataset with a proposed splatting-based projection technique. The rigid 3D pose is updated via a transformation matrix usually defined in respect of the C-Arm acquisition system reference frame, but it can also be defined in respect of the projection plane local reference frame. The optimization of the transformation is driven by two algorithms. First the hill climbing local search and secondly a proposed variant, the dense hill climbing. The latter makes the search space denser by considering the combinations of the registration parameters instead of neighboring solutions only. Although this study focused on the registration of pediatric structures, the same procedure could be applied for any cardiovascular structures involving CT-scan and X-ray angiography. Our preliminary results are promising that an accurate (3D TRE 0.265 {$\pm$} 0.647mm) and robust (99\% success rate) bi-planes registration of the aorta and MAPCAs from a initial displacement up to 20mm and 20o can be obtained within a reasonable amount of time (13.7 seconds).},
