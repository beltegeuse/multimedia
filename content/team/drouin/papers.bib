        abstract = {Cardiovascular disease is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality
in the developed world. 3D imaging of the heart's structure is critical
to the understanding and treatment of cardiovascular disease. However,
open-source tools for image analysis of cardiac images, particularly 3D
echocardiographic (3DE) data, are limited. We describe the rationale,
development, implementation, and application of SlicerHeart, a
cardiac-focused toolkit for image analysis built upon 3D Slicer, an open-
source image computing platform. We designed and implemented multiple
Python scripted modules within 3D Slicer to import, register, and view 3DE
data, including new code to volume render and crop 3DE. In addition, we
developed dedicated workflows for the modeling and quantitative analysis of
multi-modality image-derived heart models, including heart valves. Finally,
we created and integrated new functionality to facilitate the planning of
cardiac interventions and surgery. We demonstrate application of SlicerHeart
to a diverse range of cardiovascular modeling and simulation including
volume rendering of 3DE images, mitral valve modeling, transcatheter device
modeling, and planning of complex surgical intervention such as cardiac ba e
creation. SlicerHeart is an evolving open-source image processing platform
based on 3D Slicer initiated to support the investigation and treatment of
congenital heart disease. The technology in SlicerHeart provides a robust
foundation for 3D image-based investigation in cardiovascular medicine.},
